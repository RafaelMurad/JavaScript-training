    // start with strings, numbers and booleans

    // Let's say we have an array
        const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
        const team = players;

        console.log(players, team);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
        //team[3] = 'lux';

    // however what happens when we update that array?

    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
        const team2 = players.slice();

    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
        const team3 = [].concat(players);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
        const team4 = [...players];

        const team5 = Array.from(players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
         const person = {
            name: 'rafael',
            age: 23
        }

    // and think we make a copy:
        //const captain = person;
        //captain.age = 99;

    // how do we take a copy instead?
        const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {age: 24});

        console.log(cap2);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
        //const cap3 = {...person};

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

        const rafa = {
            name: 'Rafael',
